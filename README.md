## There is no language that can describe
I wrote it for myself. A way, A hope, A belief, A feel I should never forget. And a way I need to go and see to the end.

Every line is a concept, a feeling, a knowledge, a light.
Feel it, Understand it, Read it, Become it.

If you are looking to gain knowledge of all worlds, knowledge of/in everything. Knowledge.
If you are looking for an answer to your inner questions.
if you are looking for a good, for light, hope, help, and beauty.
